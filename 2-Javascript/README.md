# Programming Basics

The Programming Basics module is designed to train the participants to approach various logical problems and
develop problem solving skills, as well as teach them the basics of programming and debugging from the
ground up.

## Learning objectives

After this module the learner will â€¦
- Identify common logical problem patterns and solve them by writing algorithms
- Write programs using JavaScript
- Understand programming concepts and design patterns
- Identify and debug compilation, runtime and logical errors in JavaScript
